			In the year  = 2017, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, and August has 31 days. When we sum the total number of days in the first eight months, we get 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 243. Day of the Programmer is the 256th day, so then calculate 256 - 243 = 13 to determine that it falls on day 13 of the 9th month (September). We then print the full date in the specified format, which is 13.09.2017.

		Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.
	</p>
	<p>
		She broke her best record twice (after games  and ) and her worst record four times (after games , , , and ), so we print 2 4 as our answer. Note that she did not break her record for best score during game , as her score during that game was not strictly greater than her best record at the time.
