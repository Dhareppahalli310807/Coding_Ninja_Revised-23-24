--> 0(logn)

2) What is the return type of containsKey() function in Hashmap?
--> boolean

3)Which function is used to insert a new key and value into the hashmap?
--> put function

4)When we make each cell of our bucket array point to a linked list , it is known as _____ ?
--> seperate function

5) In which of the following collision handling methods we have a risk of filling up the bucket array and running out of space to store more keys and values ?
--> open hashing

6) What is the default value of load factor in Hashmaps?
--> 0.7

7) What is the time complexity of inserting a key and value into a hashmap?
--> 0(1)
