1) What method is used in implementation of stacks?
--> Last In First Out

2)Given an empty Stack and we perform following functions on the stack:
1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5 push(2)
What is the size of stack now?
--> 3

3)What would be the sum of elements of Stack after performing following functions:
1. push(5)
2. push(3)
3. push(4)
4. pop()
5. push(2)
--> 10

4)What should be the return type of size function in stack?
--> int

5)If initially the size of array of stack is 3,and we need to input 34 elements. How many times the doublecapacity function would be called?
--> 4

6) What is the time complexity of doublecapacity function of stack?(n is the size of previous array).
--> 0(n)
